I am Alan Lyu, a sophomore undergraduate student at Peking University pursuing a major in Physics (GPA: 3.822/4, top 10%) with a dual degree in Life Sciences. My academic focus has been particularly drawn to the Physics of Living Systems, with specific interests in applying Statistical Physics to biological systems and Systems Biology.
